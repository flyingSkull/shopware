### Shopware Server Requirements

- PHP 5.3.2 or above
- PHP's `cURL` and `GD` library
- An Apache web server
- Apache's `mod_rewrite` module
- MySQL 5.1.0 or above

### Installation via Git

Follow the instruction below if you want to install Shopware 4 using Git.

1.) Clone the git repository to the desired location using:

    git clone https://github.com/ShopwareAG/shopware-4.git

In case you wish to contribute to Shopware, fork the master tree rather than cloning it and create a pull request via Github. For further information please visit the section "Get involved" in this document.

2.) Set the correct directory permissions:

    chmod 755 config.php
    chmod 755 -R cache
    chmod 755 -R files
    chmod 755 -R media
    chmod 755 -R engine/Library/Mpdf/tmp
    chmod 755 -R engine/Library/Mpdf/ttfontdata
    chmod 755 -R engine/Shopware/Plugins/Community


Depending on your server configuration it might be neccesarry to set whole write permissions (777) to the files and folders above.
Also you can start testing with lower permissions due to security reasons (644 for example), if your php-process can write to
those files.

3.) An [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) Buildfile is used to set up the configuration and database connection:

    cd build/
    ant -Ddb.user=youruser -Ddb.password=yourpassword -Ddb.name=shopware build-database build-config

4.) Download the demo data files and extract them:

Go to the checkout directory and download the demo data files:

	wget -O demo.zip files.shopware.de/download.php?package=demo

Unzip the files to the checkout directory:

	unzip demo.zip

You can now access your shop

Backend Login: demo/demo
