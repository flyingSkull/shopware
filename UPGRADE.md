# Shopware Upgrade Information
In this document you will find a changelog of the important changes related to the code base of shopware.

## 4.1.3

* Add configuration `Always display item short descriptions in listing views`.
* `Shopware_Components_Plugin_Bootstrap::assertVersionGreaterThen()` is now an alias to  `Shopware_Components_Plugin_Bootstrap::assertMinimumVersion()` and returns always `true` if run on an development/git Version of Shopware
* Added a new method `getDefault()` in `engine/Shopware/Models/Shop/Repository.php` which returns just the default shop without calling `fixActiv()`.
* Removed the unused `downloadAction()` in `engine/Shopware/Controllers/Backend/Plugin.php`

### Deprecations
* `decompressFile()` in `/engine/Shopware/Controllers/Backend/Plugin.php`
* `decompressFile()` in `/engine/Shopware/Plugins/Default/Core/PluginManager/Controllers/Backend/PluginManager.php`

You should use the decompressFile method in the CommunityStore component instead
